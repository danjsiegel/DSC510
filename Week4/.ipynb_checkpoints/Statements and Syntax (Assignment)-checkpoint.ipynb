For the purposes of this assignment, a row is a list of values that results from splitting each line by its delimiter (in this case a comma).  As an example, if the line input is `'1,2,apple,pear'`, then row output is `['1', '2', 'apple', 'pear']`.  Do not worry about converting values or cleaning up the input data at this point. \n",

In this case, the `url` field for this record is `\"...Nicholas_Fury,_Jr._(Earth-616)#\"` and the `name_alias` field is `\"Nicholas Fury, Jr., Marcus Johnson\"`. These values are both enclosed with quote characters, which means we should not treat the commas inside the quotes as field separators.  In later assignments, we will implement code to handle escaped commas, but for now we will ignore this field.   \n",
