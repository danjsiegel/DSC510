    "1. Running `python process_csv.py  ../data/raw/avengers.csv ../data/processed/avengers_processed.csv` should generate a processed CSV file. \n",
    "2. Running `python make_report.py ../data/processed/avengers_processed.csv ../reports/top_ten_appearances.md` should generate a Markdown formatted report of the top ten Avengers by the number of their appearances. \n",
    "3. The scripts should implement a `main` function and implement `if __name__ == '__main__'` statement as shown in [Top-level script environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html) documentation. \n",
    "4. Implement any helper functions in the `msds510.util` module.  The scripts should only define one top-level function called `main`.  \n",
    "5. While you cannot use any third-party packages to complete this project, you are encouraged to use the Python Standard Library.  It is recommended that consider using the following: \n",
    "    1. `DictReader` and `DictWriter` from the `csv` module to process CSV files. \n",
    "    2. `date` and `timedelta` from the `datetime` module to work with dates. \n",
    "    3. `argv` from the `sys` module to process command line arguments. "
