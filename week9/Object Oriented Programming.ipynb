    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports two major programming paradigms; *procedural programming* and *object-oriented programming*. Up until this point, we have been using procedural programming.  Procedural programming is a form of structured programming that divides code into reusable chunks of code called procedures (also known as subroutines and functions).  Object-oriented programming divides code into objects instead of procedures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about the difference between the two paradigms is that object-oriented programming defines objects which are nouns and procedural programming defines functions which are verbs.  "
