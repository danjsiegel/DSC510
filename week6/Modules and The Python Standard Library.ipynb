    "# Modules and The Python Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we learned how to create reusable snippets of code using functions.  In this lesson, we are going to take things a step further and learn how to create collections of reusable functions and other code by creating *modules* and *packages*.  Modules allow you to write a function or other code once and reuse it for different projects.  A package is a collection of related modules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before learning how to create your own modules and packages, we will explore the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) of packages and modules.  One of the things that makes Python so popular is its \"batteries included\" philosophy.  It is important for you to understand what is already included in the standard library, so you don't end up \"reinventing the wheel.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "After learning how to import and reuse code written by others, you will go on to create your own reusable modules and packages. We will also be learning about how to create Python scripts and use Python from the command line.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, while Jupyter Notebook is good for adhoc Python code, it is not an ideal tool for creating reusable Python modules.  It is at this point we will introduce you to an integrated development environment (IDE) in the form of [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).  "

    "Up until this point, you have been able to complete all of your assignments and examples in a single Jupyter Notebook.  Real-world data science projects are rarely this simple and will require multiple files including Python source code, HTML reports, PDF reference material, source data, processed data, and documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To manage the complexity of a larger data analysis project, we need to organize and structure our project properly.  For this class, we will use a project structure loosely based on [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the directory structure we will be using throughout the rest of the course.  You may not need every directory and file for each assignment or project.  For instance, the `.gitignore` file is used by the Git version control system which we will introduce in later lessons.  Similarly, the `docs` folder is for project-level documentation and will not be needed until the final project.  \n",
