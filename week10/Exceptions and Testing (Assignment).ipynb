    "Starting from your local repository's `master` branch, create a branch called `exceptions-and-testing`.  This is branch you will use to complete this assignment.  You will submit this branch as a pull request and use the pull request review feature to have others review your assignment.  You will merge this branch into the `master` branch once you have completed the assignment. If you have additional questions, follow the instructions for submitting a Github repository in the *Submitting Assignments* document.  This assignment uses code reviews, so make sure you have two people review your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this assignment, you will submit two files, one called `util.py` contains the implementation of the the utility functions described below, and one called `test_util.py` that implements the unit tests for those functions.  Add these files to `msds510` repository you created in an earlier assignment. The `test_util.py` file should contain a `if __name__ == '__main__'` statement that runs the unit tests when run as a script. Use Python's `unittest` framework and use a single `TestCase` for all of the unit tests. \n"
